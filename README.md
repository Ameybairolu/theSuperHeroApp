# theSuperHeroApp

Link to hosted website: https://ameybairolu.github.io/theSuperHeroApp/

The API used in the project: https://superheroapi.com/

Features:
  1. User can search for their favourite/any SuperHero.
  2. The website renders cards of all the superheroes whose names contain the search query.
  3. When user clicks on any card, the website displays the highlighted card beautifully and also displays all the basic information about the target superhero.
  4. We can add/remove a superhero to/from the favourites.
  5. The superheroes added to the favourites are retained even after page reload as the data of favourites is stored in the localStorage.
  6. The webpage obtains data using AJAX features.
  7. Error handling is also performed when the website is unable to fetch data from the API for any reason.
  8. I have added a timeout feature which throws an error message when the webpage takes longer to obtain data due to any reason.
  9. A spinner is displayed before the data is rendered so that the user knows that the webpage is loading.
